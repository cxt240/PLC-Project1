Interpreter is the file containing the compiler.
To run interpreter given file filename.txt with class called 'className, call the function run like this:

(interpret "filename.txt" 'Class)

To test all files, just run TestSuite3.scm file
TestSuites 1 and 2 and 3 no longer apply to the project. To use those test suites, open the .zip files containing part 4 and run those tests using that version of the interpreter.
